# Code Splitting




## Dynamic import

The import(module) expression loads the module and returns a promise that 
resolves into a module object that contains all its exports. It can be called
from any place in the code.


```js
import("./math").then(math => {
    console.log(math.add(16, 26));
});
```

### Reminder
import/export statements are static. 
- They are very simple and strict and is not a function.
- module path can only be primitive string, not dynamic, not function
